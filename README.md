# liri-node-app

This is an app that accepts a few different inputs:

* my-tweets
* spotify-this-song "[song artist]"
* movie-this "[movie title]"

And will output the last 20 tweets of a user (set to my Twitter handle by default), information from spotify about a song, or information about a movie.
